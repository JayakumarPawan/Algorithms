find the bottom
draw horizontal line
sort points by polar angle (use cosine)

use stack and put first 2 elements
for( i = index 2 to the end)
	current = vector[i]
	prev= stack.pop()
	(A) oneBeforePrev= stack.pop() //or peek
	if isLeftTurn(oneBeforePrev,prev,current) //not straight
		stack.push( oneBeforePrev,prev,current)

	else: //right or co-linear
		prev = oneBeforePrev
		oneBeforePrev = stack.pop()
		go to A
end for loop
