shape is convex if for every pair of points, the line segment formed between them is bounded by the shape

look at wikipedia
Quick hull: 
	avg O(nlogn) worst o(n^2) 
	recursive
graham hull
	always O(nlogn)

make ppm with 50 points and the convex hull
shape is represented by a vector of points (order matters)
